# Git Workflow Rules

## Commits
- Write clear commit messages: imperative mood, under 72 chars
- Format: type(scope): description (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore)
- One logical change per commit — don't mix refactors with features
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files

## Branches
- Use feature branches from main/develop
- Name branches: type/short-description (feature/add-auth, fix/login-crash)
- Keep branches short-lived — merge within days, not weeks
- Delete branches after merging

## Pull Requests
- Write descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Include: what changed, why, how to test, screenshots if UI
- Keep PRs focused and reviewable (under 400 lines changed)
- Request reviews from relevant code owners

## History
- Use rebase for feature branches (clean linear history)
- Use merge commits for main branch merges (preserve context)
- Squash fixup commits before merging
- Never force-push shared branches

## Protection
- Protect main/production branches — require PR reviews
- Run CI checks before merge is allowed
- Use signed commits for release branches
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
