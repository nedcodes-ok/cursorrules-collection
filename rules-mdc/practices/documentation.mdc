# Documentation Rules

## Code Documentation
- Document public APIs with clear descriptions and examples
- Explain parameters, return values, and thrown exceptions
- Document non-obvious behavior and edge cases
- Update docs when code changes — stale docs are worse than none

## README
- Start with what the project does in one sentence
- Include: quick start, installation, usage examples, configuration
- Keep examples copy-pasteable and tested
- Link to detailed docs for advanced topics

## Architecture
- Document high-level architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Include diagrams for complex systems (use Mermaid or similar)
- Explain the WHY behind architectural choices
- Keep architecture docs close to the code they describe

## Comments in Code
- Explain WHY, not WHAT (code shows what)
- Document workarounds with links to issues/tickets
- Use doc comments for public APIs, inline for complex logic
- Remove outdated comments immediately

## Maintenance
- Review docs quarterly — delete what's outdated
- Treat docs as code — review in PRs
- Use consistent formatting and terminology
- Automate API documentation from code where possible
