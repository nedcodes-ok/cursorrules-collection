# Accessibility Rules

## Semantic HTML
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, don't skip)
- Use semantic elements: nav, main, article, aside, footer
- Use button for actions, a for navigation — never div for either
- Use form labels — every input needs an associated label

## ARIA
- Use ARIA only when HTML semantics aren't sufficient
- Set aria-label for icon-only buttons
- Use aria-live for dynamic content updates
- Use role attributes sparingly — semantic HTML is preferred

## Keyboard
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Use visible focus indicators (never outline: none without replacement)
- Implement logical tab order
- Support Escape to close modals/dropdowns

## Visual
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Support text resizing up to 200% without breaking layout
- Provide alt text for meaningful images, empty alt for decorative

## Testing
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Test with a screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA)
- Run automated checks (axe, Lighthouse accessibility)
- Include accessibility in code review checklist
