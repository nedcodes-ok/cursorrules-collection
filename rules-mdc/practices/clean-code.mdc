# Clean Code Rules

## Naming
- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood (URL, ID, HTTP)
- Name booleans as questions: isActive, hasPermission, canEdit
- Name functions as actions: fetchUser, calculateTotal, validateInput

## Functions
- Do one thing — if you can extract a paragraph, it's doing too much
- Keep parameter count to 3 or fewer — use objects for more
- Return early to avoid deep nesting (guard clauses)
- Avoid side effects in functions that return values

## Structure
- Keep files under 300 lines — split when larger
- Group related code together (co-location)
- One concept per file in most cases
- Order: exports/public first, helpers/private last

## Comments
- Write code that explains itself — comments for WHY, not WHAT
- Use comments for: business rules, workarounds, non-obvious decisions
- Delete commented-out code — that's what git is for
- Keep TODO comments with ticket numbers

## Simplicity
- Prefer simple, boring solutions over clever ones
- Don't abstract prematurely — wait for the third instance
- Remove dead code aggressively
- Optimize for readability first, performance when measured
