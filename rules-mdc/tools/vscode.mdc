# VS Code / Cursor Rules

## Workspace Setup
- Use .vscode/settings.json for project-specific settings
- Configure formatters to run on save
- Use recommended extensions list (.vscode/extensions.json)
- Set consistent editor config (indent, line endings, trim whitespace)

## Debugging
- Configure launch.json for common debug scenarios
- Use compound configurations for multi-service debugging
- Set meaningful breakpoint conditions
- Use logpoints instead of console.log

## Productivity
- Use multi-cursor editing for repetitive changes
- Use workspace search with file/folder filters
- Configure task runners for common build commands
- Use snippets for frequently typed patterns

## Cursor AI Specific
- Place .cursorrules in project root for auto-loading
- Keep rules focused and specific to the project
- Update rules as project conventions evolve
- Use rules to enforce team standards consistently

## Project Config
- Include editor config in version control
- Document required extensions in README
- Use consistent formatting across the team
- Configure file associations for custom extensions
