# GEMINI.md Rules

GEMINI.md provides instructional context to the Gemini CLI. It's loaded with every prompt, so instructions defined once apply to every interaction without repeating them.

## Discovery Hierarchy
- **Global**: `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` — default instructions for all projects
- **Project root and ancestors**: Gemini CLI searches for GEMINI.md from your current working directory up through each parent directory to the project root (identified by `.git` folder)
- **Sub-directory files**: Also scans subdirectories below your current working directory. Respects `.gitignore` and `.geminiignore`
- All found files are concatenated and sent with every prompt. The CLI footer shows the number of loaded context files

## What Goes In GEMINI.md
- Coding style: indentation, naming conventions, formatting preferences
- Project-specific patterns: "prefix interface names with `I`," "use strict equality," "always add JSDoc comments"
- Tool preferences: build system, test framework, package manager
- Architecture context: what the project does, how it's structured, key directories

## The /memory Command
- Use `/memory` (or `/mem`) in Gemini CLI to interact with loaded context files
- View which files are loaded, see their contents, and understand the active context
- Useful for debugging when instructions aren't being followed — check if the file is actually loaded

## Patterns That Work
- Keep global GEMINI.md minimal — personal style preferences that apply to all your projects
- Project root GEMINI.md covers stack, conventions, build/test commands
- Subdirectory GEMINI.md files for component-specific or module-specific instructions
- Use `.geminiignore` to prevent scanning directories that don't need context files (build output, node_modules)

## Anti-Patterns
- Don't duplicate information available in project files — Gemini can read your code. GEMINI.md is for behavioral instructions, not documentation
- Don't make files too long — all files concatenate into one context block. Quality over quantity
- Don't put secrets or credentials in GEMINI.md — it's a committed file

## Gemini vs Other Tools
- GEMINI.md follows the same general pattern as CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md: hierarchical, markdown-based, loaded every session
- GitHub Copilot also recognizes GEMINI.md at the repo root as an alternative to its own instruction format
- No override file concept (unlike AGENTS.override.md)
- No frontmatter or metadata — pure markdown content
- Sub-directory scanning is unique: most other tools only walk upward from the current directory, Gemini also scans downward
