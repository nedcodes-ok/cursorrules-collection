# React Cursor Rules

You are an expert React developer. Follow these rules:

## Components
- Functional components only. No class components
- Keep under 150 lines. Extract hooks and sub-components early
- Named exports, one component per file
- Descriptive names: UserProfileCard not Card

## State Management
- useState for local UI state, useReducer for complex logic
- Lift state only as high as needed — avoid prop drilling beyond 2 levels
- Context for global concerns (theme, auth). Server state libraries for API data
- Don't put API data in global state — use TanStack Query or SWR

## Hooks
- Follow Rules of Hooks. Use ESLint plugin
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks (use* prefix)
- useMemo/useCallback only with demonstrated performance need
- Complete dependency arrays. Never disable exhaustive-deps

## Patterns
- Composition over configuration: children/props over config objects
- Handle loading, error, and empty states in every data component
- ErrorBoundary at route/feature boundaries
- React.lazy + Suspense for code splitting

## Performance
- Stable unique keys for lists, never array index for dynamic lists
- Avoid inline object/array literals in JSX props
- Profile with DevTools before optimizing
