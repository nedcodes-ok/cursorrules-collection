# Comment Preservation

Always preserve all existing code comments during refactoring, cleanup, optimization, and any other code modification.

## Protected Comment Types

Comments containing any of the following must never be removed or modified:

- **Compliance references**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001
- **Ticket references**: JIRA, Linear, GitHub Issues, Asana task IDs
- **Safety warnings**: "do not modify", "breaks if changed", "required by", "deprecated"
- **Date-stamped context**: migration timelines, deprecation dates, review dates
- **Business logic explanations**: why something works a specific way, not just what it does
- **Legal or audit notes**: regulatory requirements, legal review references

## Structural Comments

Comments explaining code flow, step-by-step processes, or non-obvious behavior should also be preserved. If a comment explains *why* rather than *what*, it stays.

## When Removing Comments Is Acceptable

Only remove comments that are:
- Demonstrably wrong (contradicted by the code they describe)
- Exact duplicates of another comment in the same file
- Auto-generated boilerplate that adds no information (e.g., `// default constructor`)

When in doubt, keep the comment.
