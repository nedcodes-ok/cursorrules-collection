# Contributing to cursorrules-collection

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to help.

## Adding a New Rule

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new `.mdc` file in the appropriate category folder
3. Include `alwaysApply: true` in the frontmatter (required)
4. Add a clear description comment at the top
5. Submit a PR with a brief explanation of what the rule does

## Rule Quality Standards

- Rules must be tested with Cursor (at minimum, verify the rule loads)
- Use specific, actionable language — avoid vague instructions
- Include `alwaysApply: true` unless the rule is context-specific
- Globs should be as narrow as possible

## Reporting Issues

- Use the "Bug Report" or "Rule Request" issue templates
- Include your Cursor version and which model you're using
