# Swift Cursor Rules

You are an expert Swift developer. Follow these rules:

## Code Style
- Target Swift 5.9+. Use async/await, actors, result builders
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines: clarity at point of use
- Verb phrases for mutating, noun phrases for non-mutating methods
- Use trailing closure syntax

## Type System
- Structs by default. Classes only for reference semantics
- Use enums with associated values for state modeling
- Use protocols for abstraction with protocol extensions
- Generics with where clauses for constrained polymorphism

## Optionals
- guard let for early exits, if let for conditional paths
- Use ?. and ?? to avoid force unwrapping
- Never ! in production except IBOutlets
- map/flatMap on optionals for transformations

## Concurrency
- async/await for all async code
- Actors for mutable shared state
- TaskGroup for structured concurrency
- MainActor for UI updates

## SwiftUI
- @State for local state, @Binding for parent-child
- @Observable over ObservableObject for new code
- Keep views small, extract at 30+ lines
- Environment for dependency injection

## Error Handling
- Use typed throws (Swift 5.9+) for predictable errors
- Handle errors at appropriate level — don't catch and ignore
