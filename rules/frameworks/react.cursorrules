# React Rules

## Components
- Use functional components exclusively
- Keep components under 150 lines — extract when larger
- Use named exports for components
- Co-locate styles, tests, and types with components

## Hooks
- Follow Rules of Hooks strictly
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic (useXxx naming)
- Use useMemo/useCallback only for expensive operations or stable references
- Keep useEffect dependencies minimal and accurate

## State Management
- Lift state only as high as needed
- Use useReducer for complex state logic
- Derive state from existing state — don't sync with useEffect
- Use context for truly global state (theme, auth, locale)

## Patterns
- Use composition over prop drilling
- Use children prop for wrapper components
- Use render props or custom hooks over HOCs
- Handle loading/error/empty states explicitly

## Performance
- Use React.lazy for route-level code splitting
- Use key prop correctly — stable, unique identifiers
- Avoid inline object/function creation in JSX props
- Use React.memo sparingly — profile before optimizing
