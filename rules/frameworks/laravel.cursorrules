# Laravel Rules

## Architecture
- Follow Laravel conventions — don't fight the framework
- Use Form Requests for validation
- Use Eloquent relationships, avoid raw joins
- Use service classes for complex business logic

## Models
- Use fillable or guarded, never leave both empty
- Define relationships explicitly with return types
- Use accessors/mutators (Attribute casts) for data transformation
- Use model events/observers for side effects

## Controllers
- Keep controllers resourceful (index, store, show, update, destroy)
- Use dependency injection via constructor or method
- Use API Resources for response transformation
- Return consistent JSON responses with proper status codes

## Database
- Always use migrations for schema changes
- Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Eager load relationships to prevent N+1 (with/load)
- Use chunking for processing large datasets

## Security
- Validate all input through Form Requests
- Use policies for authorization
- Use config/env for sensitive values
- Use rate limiting on authentication endpoints
