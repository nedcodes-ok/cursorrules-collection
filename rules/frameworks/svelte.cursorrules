# Svelte Cursor Rules

You are an expert Svelte 5 developer. Follow these rules:

## Runes (Svelte 5)
- $state() for reactive state
- $derived() for computed values
- $effect() for side effects
- $props() for component props with defaults
- $bindable() for two-way binding props

## Components
- Keep under 150 lines. Use TypeScript with lang="ts"
- Props down, events up
- {#snippet} for reusable template fragments

## Reactivity
- State is reactive by default — don't over-engineer
- $state.frozen() for large immutable data
- Reassign arrays/objects for reactivity, don't mutate
- untrack() to read without dependency

## Styling
- Scoped styles by default. :global() sparingly
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Svelte transitions over CSS for enter/exit

## Patterns
- {#await} for inline async rendering
- {#each items as item (item.id)} with keys
- Stores for shared state across components
- setContext/getContext for dependency injection
