# Vue Rules

## Composition API
- Use <script setup> syntax for components
- Use ref() for primitives, reactive() for objects
- Use computed() for derived state
- Use composables (useXxx) for reusable logic

## Components
- Use single-file components (.vue)
- Keep templates readable — extract complex logic to computed/methods
- Use defineProps with TypeScript type syntax
- Use defineEmits for type-safe event emission

## State Management
- Use Pinia for global state management
- Keep stores focused on a single domain
- Use getters for derived state in stores
- Use composables for shared logic that isn't global state

## Patterns
- Use v-model with defineModel for two-way binding
- Use provide/inject for deep component tree data
- Use Suspense with async setup for loading states
- Use Teleport for modals and overlays

## Performance
- Use v-once for static content
- Use shallowRef/shallowReactive for large objects
- Lazy-load routes with defineAsyncComponent
