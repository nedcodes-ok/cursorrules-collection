# Code Review Rules

## As a Reviewer
- Review for: correctness, readability, maintainability, security
- Be specific — point to the line, suggest the fix
- Ask questions instead of making demands
- Approve when good enough — don't block on style preferences

## What to Check
- Does the code do what the PR says it does?
- Are edge cases and error paths handled?
- Are there tests for the new behavior?
- Are there security implications (input validation, auth, data exposure)?
- Is the code understandable without the PR description?

## As an Author
- Self-review before requesting review — catch the obvious stuff
- Write a clear PR description with context
- Respond to all comments, even if just acknowledging
- Don't take feedback personally — it's about the code

## Conventions
- Use conventional comments: suggestion:, question:, nit:, issue:
- Mark blocking vs non-blocking feedback clearly
- Keep discussions on the PR, not in side channels
- Resolve threads when addressed

## Speed
- Review within 24 hours of request
- Small PRs get faster reviews — keep them under 400 lines
- Don't let reviews block progress for days
